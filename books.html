    <h1>Off Season - Jack Ketchum</h1>
    <h2>"Always liked my sins pure and take it as it comes."</h2>

        Cannibalism and the average American adults-- this book is as unpleasant as it gets. 
        Yet somehow the most disturbing part of the book still managed to be the scene before all the gore. IYKYK.
