        I'm trying to build a zombie deck in Master Duel, but I keep pulling dupes. For an archetype that's already so 
        far from the meta, they're really making it hard for me.

        Oftentimes, I crave cashews.
        I possibly don't have much else to think about.

        It may be a blessing that I have a peanut allergy. I hear all the time of peanut obsessions, but 
        never of cashew obsessions-- I'm probably hung up on the next best thing.
